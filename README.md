   This project tackles the classic Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. By systematically trying different values in each cell, it eliminates invalid placements and finds a solution that adheres to Sudoku's rules. This project serves as a gateway to understanding backtracking, a powerful algorithm used to solve problems with constraints, like scheduling or resource allocation.
